An app created to download files from Playstation Home servers. This application simply spoofs the useragent to "PSHome PS3Application libhttp/4.9.0-000 (CellOS)". 

This application can be used to download from any server, Just change the "Replace Domain" box to suit your chosen server. 

## Notes:
- This application can NOT bypass any whitelist. You must get whitelisted to play BEFORE using this application.
- Then it allows you to download the sdat files without needing to use the Home client and then pull the sdats from cache.
- If enabled it can auto check for associated ODC/SDC/PNGs to match the downloaded sdats.
